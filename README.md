This project focuses on classifying human facial expressions into one of seven emotion categories — Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral — using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the FER2013 dataset. The model interprets facial features from images and accurately predicts the displayed emotion.

The application is built as a full-stack web solution, integrating Python (with Flask as the backend framework) and a responsive frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. LeafletJS is used for dynamic mapping or UI elements (if applicable), and SQL Server is used for database management.

Key Features:

Deep learning model (CNN) trained on FER2013 dataset

Real-time emotion detection via webcam or image upload

Interactive and responsive UI

Backend powered by Flask and SQL Server for data handling

Frontend enhanced with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and LeafletJS
